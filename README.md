## Description:
Welcome to the Calgary Flames Tracker (2021 Version)!
This is a simple Java application that allows you to track the stats of Calgary Flames players, edit stats, and view various leaders of goals/assists. You can also simualte games with other NHL teams in order to input new game data. With endless customizability options, such as being able to add your own players/goalies, the possibilites are endless.

## Usage:
Run using the command:
java --module-path "(your file path to the JavaFX lib folder)" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar calgaryFlamesJar.jar

You will be then greeted with this:

You now have the options under "File" to:
1. Open a roster file
2. Save a roster file
3. Load an empty roster

Or you can create your own roster by adding in your own players.

Game simulations look like this (for testing purposes, both team are CGY but can be changed):

Enter in an amount of shots for each team, goalie that played, goal(s), (optional) and players that did not play to finish the game simulation.
